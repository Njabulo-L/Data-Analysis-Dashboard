# Cyclora Store Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard created using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Cyclora is a multinational bicycle company with a growing presence across Europe, North America, and the Pacific. To support targeted marketing and drive strategic growth, the company aims to gain deeper insights into the demographic makeup of its customer base across these key regions. This data analysis project investigates purchasing trends using metrics such as gender, age, and marital status. The objective is to identify which customer groups and regions contribute most to sales, and to pinpoint opportunities for increasing engagement in less active markets. By leveraging these insights, Cyclora can refine its marketing efforts, tailor outreach to specific demographics, and expand its reach in emerging or underserved markets through data-driven strategies.

## Dataset used 
- <a href=https://github.com/Njabulo-L/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx>Cyclora Data</a>

## Questions 
- Which gender purchased the most bikes?
- Which age bracket accounted for the highest number of bike purchases?
- Which marital status group purchased the most bikes?
- How far from work do the majority of bike-buying customers live?

## Process
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Verified the dataset for duplicates, missing values, and anomalies.
- Ensured consistency in data types, formats, and value ranges across all fields.
### Data Analysis
- Created pivot tables to address each of the key business questions (e.g. gender, age group, marital status, commute distance).
- Analysed relationships between demographic attributes and bike purchase behaviour.
### Dashboard Development 
- Combined all pivot tables into a single interactive dashboard using Power BI.
- Applied slicers (e.g. by region, age group, gender) to allow dynamic filtering and enhanced user exploration of the data.

## Key Findings 
### Gender: 
Male customers are more likely to purchase bikes than female customers, likely due to higher average income levels.
### Age: 
Middle-aged customers (ages 30–53) account for the majority of bike purchases.
### Commute Distance: 
Customers living within 0–1 mile of work made up the largest portion of bike buyers, followed by those living 2–5 miles away.
### Regional Insights:
#### Europe: 
Bike purchases were dominated by middle-aged customers (both single and married) living within 0–1 mile of work.
#### North America: 
The highest sales came from middle-aged customers (both single and married) living 2–5 miles from work, followed by single middle-aged customers within 0–1 mile.
#### Pacific: 
Most purchases were made by single middle-aged customers living 0–1 mile from work, followed closely by those living 2–5 miles away.

## Final Conclusion
The most likely bike buyers are males aged 31–53 who live within 0–5 miles of their workplace.
As the distance from work increases, the likelihood of purchasing a bike decreases. Therefore, marketing and sales efforts should target customers living within a 5-mile radius of their workplace to maximise sales potential.
