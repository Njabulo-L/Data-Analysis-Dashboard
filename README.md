# Cyclora-Store-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard created using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Cyclora is a multinational bicycle company with a growing presence across Europe, North America, and the Pacific. To support targeted marketing and drive strategic growth, the company aims to gain deeper insights into the demographic makeup of its customer base across these key regions. This data analysis project investigates purchasing trends using metrics such as gender, age, and marital status. The objective is to identify which customer groups and regions contribute most to sales, and to pinpoint opportunities for increasing engagement in less active markets. By leveraging these insights, Cyclora can refine its marketing efforts, tailor outreach to specific demographics, and expand its reach in emerging or underserved markets through data-driven strategies.

## Process
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Verified the dataset for duplicates, missing values, and anomalies.
- Ensured consistency in data types, formats, and value ranges across all fields.
### Data Analysis
- Created pivot tables to address each of the key business questions (e.g. gender, age group, marital status, commute distance).
- Analysed relationships between demographic attributes and bike purchase behaviour.
### Dashboard Development 
- Combined all pivot tables into a single interactive dashboard using Power BI.
- Applied slicers (e.g. by region, age group, gender) to allow dynamic filtering and enhanced user exploration of the data.
